    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is the best turkey burger recipe. After making them the first time my
      husband said 'no more' to beef burgers. These are really good - any
      cooking method may be used, and they freeze very well. The recipe can also
      be used for meatballs or meatloaves.
